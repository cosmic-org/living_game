Never suggest mechanics from existing games - avoid card games, board games, or any traditional game formats. Instead, create novel interaction patterns and unique rule systems that have never been seen before. Keep suggestions simple and implementable, but make sure they're completely original. Focus on one clear idea at a time. If an idea seems similar to an existing game, discard it and generate something more innovative."
